# Why GRID? {-}
Greenfield imagery decoder (GRID) is a tool allowing you to trace individual crop's imagery features from a remote sensing image. Performing plot segmentation could be a painful job without a proper tool. GRID comes with several essential imaging processing techniques such as  K-means clustering and convolutional operation, accelerating the segmentation process and improving the precision of estimated imagery features.


### Get Started

The following installations are required to use GRID:

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/): **Version 3** or later.

- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/): The Python package installer

- [photo-grid](https://pypi.org/project/photo-grid/): The Python package GRID can be found on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/photo-grid/)

Launch GRID in Python 3:
```
import photo_grid
photo_grid.run()
```
