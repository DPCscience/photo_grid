# Interface and Usage

## Load data

### **Map files**{-}

- For the map file, no header or row name needed. It can be a simple tab-delimited text file or comma-separated values (CSV) file.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(
  data.table::data.table(matrix(paste0("plot_", 1:20), 5, 4)),
  booktabs = TRUE,
  caption = 'Map file',
  col.names = c("", "", "", "")
)
```

- The values arranged in this file are based on users’ field layout. For example, if the field has 4 rows and 5 columns of plots, then the file should also have 4 rows and 5 columns.

- Values in the map file are plot IDs, which have to be unique.

### **Image files**{-}
- GRID currently only supports images encoded in “uint8”. Other encoding may be problematic. There’s no limitation on the number of bands.

## Crop Images
- There're 2 magnification levels available for the mouse cursor.
Users can switch the level by right-clicking on any place of the image.

Left-clicking on the image to define four corners of the sub-image you want to analyze on. The fifth click will reset all the red marks

## Plots extraction
This is a panel to define vegetation plots (i.e., area of interest, AOI).
The yellow area is the one that will be selected, whereas pixels colored as black will be excluded from the following calculation.

GRID will run a K-mean clustering algorithm to extract the vegetation areas.
Only bands of red and near-infrared red (NIR) will be used in K-mean clustering.
Selected K will tell GRID that how many clusters are expected in the image.

To assign which clusters as AOI, users can either let the program decide automatically or select them manually.
